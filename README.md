# Music-Player
A simple music player in JAVA.
A music menu where you can add your song and play it.

The menu has options as follows:
P = play; Q = quit; R = reset; S = stop; L = loop; 

The volume can be controlled by altering the dB(deciBels).
This supports (.wav) file format. I have added one into the repository, however you can add your own tracks.
(https://convertio.co/mp3-wav/) You can go to this website and change .mp3 to .wav file.
